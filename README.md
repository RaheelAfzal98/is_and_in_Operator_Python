# Assignment 3: Exploring `is` and `in` in Python

## 📘 What You'll Learn
In Python, `is` and `in` are often confused, but they serve very different purposes. This guide will help you understand how each works through clear examples and analogies.

---

## 🔍 Understanding the `is` Operator

### What It Does
The `is` operator compares the **identity** of two objects. It checks whether both variables point to the **exact same memory location**, not just whether they hold the same value.

### 🔑 Real-Life Analogy
Think of two keys that look the same. They might unlock similar doors, but unless they are literally the *same key*, they're different. The `is` operator checks whether two variables are referencing the exact same object.

### 🧪 Python Example
```python
a = [10, 20, 30]
b = [10, 20, 30]
c = a

print(a is b)  # False – same content, different memory
print(a is c)  # True – same object in memory

✅ Use Case
Use is when you need to verify if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

🔎 Exploring the in Operator
What It Does
The in operator checks whether a specific value exists inside a container like a list, string, tuple, or dictionary.

🧳 Real-Life Analogy
You’re checking whether your name is listed on a guest list. You don't care where the list came from—just whether your name is in it.

🧪 Python Example

languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java"]
print("Python" in languages)   # True
print("C++" in languages)      # False

✅ Use Case
Use in to check whether a value exists within a sequence or iterable.

| Feature   | `is` Operator          | `in` Operator                          |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Identity (same object) | Membership (existence in a collection) |
| Used With | Any object             | Lists, tuples, strings, sets, etc.     |
| Returns   | `True` or `False`      | `True` or `False`                      |
| Example   | `a is b`               | `"apple" in fruits`                    |

🧠 Concept Summary Diagram
           IDENTITY CHECK (`is`)
      +------------------------------+
      | Are both variables pointing |
      | to the exact same object?   |
      +------------------------------+

         MEMBERSHIP CHECK (`in`)
      +------------------------------+
      | Does this element exist in  |
      | the collection?             |
      +------------------------------+

🏁 Final Thoughts

✅ Use **is** when checking if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

✅ Use **in** when checking if a value exists inside a collection.

🚀 Try It Yourself!
Experiment by writing a few examples using both is and in to reinforce your understanding. Happy coding!
